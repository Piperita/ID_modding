## About the scripts
The scripts in the subfolders are tweaks to the IntenseDebate commenting system, specialised on the one used by Equestria Daily.

They were created as add-ons to DarknessKight's <a href="https://github.com/Darknesskight/PonyDebate">Pony Debate</a> script and are currently in the beta-stage - They have all basic functions implemented and do their job but they still need to be tweaked for performance or design.

## The individual scripts
All scripts have a dedicated manual inside their folder. 
Their general functions are:

#### Filter
Circumvents the filter to allow banned words by adding empty characters inside the offensive substring

#### LinkPreview
Adds buttons to every ĺink inside a comment that open (or close) an interactive window with the linked site.

#### Padding
Imposes a minimal width of 300px for comments.

#### CountReplies
A script for bluefury700; crawls o every page and returns a csv-file with authors, text and the number of replies.
